# scripts
I will be adding all my public scripts here. 
So far we have...

"howold" this is a simple script using tune2fs to look at 
the date your / was created which is the easiest way to 
tell how old a system is. 

"upd" this is a quick and dirty way to automatically run 
updates and cleanups and report if you need a reboot of 
your system or not... Please use with caution.

"speedtest" this will perform a network speed test using 
ookla's test servers.
 
"conkyrestart" it does what it says. Kills and restarts 
your conky.
